1. represent the cube
- rubiks cube class
- 3d array
    - array of colors
    - 6 x 3 x 3
    - flattened representation of cube
- isSolved
- solve score?

2. add cube movements
- all movements are relative to "front" face in the representation

3. create graph of cube states
- graph node class
- contains a cube and all neighbors, as well as last move

4. do a* search, looking for solved cube position
- heuristic: portion of cubes in "correct" position
    - if 2 colors are touching and same color, then they are "correct"

5.
